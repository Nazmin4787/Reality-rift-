📘 REALITY RIFT – GAME & AI DOCUMENTATION (UPDATED)
🧱 1️⃣ Introduction

Reality Rift is a psychological puzzle-survival web game based on the Stranger Things – Upside Down theme.
The objective is to escape through a chain of logical and psychological trap-based levels.

The game tests:

calmness

memory

observation

timing

paradox thinking

resistance under pressure

🧠 AI runs locally/offline using Tiny ML (TensorFlow.js) — no APIs, no cloud.

🕹️ 2️⃣ Game Concept

The player enters a corrupted “reverse-logic” universe.
To escape, the player must complete 3 puzzle levels → then face final paradox escape.

🎮 Game is UI + cognitive-logic based — no movement, no WASD, controlled only using:

clicks

decisions

timing

observation

🧩 4️⃣ Level Explanation (DETAILED)
🟥 Level 1 – Red Signal / Dead Signal

Objective: Drag puzzle pieces ONLY when allowed.

Element	Description
Mechanic	Player drags 3 fragments into central slot
Control Rule	Allowed ONLY when HUM sound plays
Trap	Visual effects distract – audio is the true signal
Lose Condition	Dragging anything during STATIC → reset + flashing screen

🧠 Purpose: tests attention, listening & ignoring visuals

🟦 Level 2 – Time Glitch Corridor

Objective: Find the single real clock among glitching ones.

Element	Description
Corridor	Series of clocks – most reverse, freeze, loop, glitch
Logic	Only 1 clock follows real-world time
Action	Choose door linked to the real-time clock

Lose Condition → Choose glitch door
Purpose → Tests observation + filtering distraction

🟩 Level 3 – Christmas Light Paradox

Objective: Decode hidden message using correct blinking pattern.

Element	Description
Wall of Lights	A-Z letters blink on wall
Fake Lights	Blink fast, change color, spell fake misleading words
Real Lights	Slow rhythmic blink appears after silence
Action	Click only 3 real letters to form code

Lose Condition → Clicking fake blinking light
Purpose → Tests pattern recognition & patience

🟪 FINAL LEVEL – System Paradox

Objective: Escape by understanding paradox logic — no instructions shown.

Component	Description
Setup	3 doors – Red, Blue, Green
Instinct Trap	Red looks safe → wrong
Distraction	Blue flickers → fake tension
Hidden Correct	Green looks blocked – but opens only when walking BACKWARD

🧠 Rule:
👉 Correct action = opposite of instinct

Outcome → Escape to Real World
Purpose → Tests reverse-logic thinking

🧠 5️⃣ Tiny ML – AI Component (Offline)

AI uses TensorFlow.js and runs locally.
It adapts difficulty based on behavior.

ML Inputs
Input	Meaning
clickSpeed	High → panic
hesitationTime	Long → more control
mistakeCount	Cognitive overload
survivalTime	resilience
Output
difficulty_level = 0 (easy), 1 (normal), 2 (hard)

Example Logic:
if (difficulty == 2) {
  glitchIntensity = "HIGH";
  whisperSound = true;
  pressureRate += 2;
}


⚡ Model Architecture:

Dense (3 inputs) → Dense (8 neurons) → Dense (3 outputs softmax)

🧱 6️⃣ System Architecture (Text)
Frontend: React UI (Screens, Animations, Audio)
↓
Game Logic State Machine (levels, timers, traps)
↓
TensorFlow.js ML Module (local behavior prediction)
↓
Difficulty Controller (adjusts glitches, audio, effects)
